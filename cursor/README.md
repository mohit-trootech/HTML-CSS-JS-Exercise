# Pseudo Cursor Effect

This project demonstrates how to create a custom pseudo cursor effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description

The pseudo cursor effect replaces the default cursor with a custom styled element that follows the user's mouse movements across the screen. This enhances user experience by adding a visually appealing interaction without relying on traditional cursor styles.

### Features

- **Custom Cursor**: The cursor is implemented as a styled `<div>` element (`.cursor`) that dynamically adjusts its position based on mouse movements.
- **Interactive Element**: The main content area (`div.main`) triggers a transformation of the cursor element when hovered over, demonstrating an interactive effect.
- **Styling**: The project includes basic styling for the cursor and the main content area to enhance visibility and aesthetic appeal.

## Usage

To use this code:

1. Copy the HTML structure into your HTML file.
2. Insert the JavaScript code into a `<script>` tag or link to an external JavaScript file.
3. Apply the CSS styles to your CSS file or within a `<style>` tag in your HTML file.

Adjust the CSS styles (`#cursor`, `div.main`, etc.) as needed to fit your design preferences.
