### Tips:
- **Table Format**: Use the markdown table (`| Project Name | Description | Link |`) to organize project names, descriptions, and links neatly.
- **Description**: Keep project descriptions brief but informative to give readers an idea of what each project entails.
- **Links**: Replace `[Link to Project X](https://example.com/projectX)` with actual URLs to live demos, repositories, or other relevant resources.
- **Detailed Sections**: Maintain detailed sections (`## Project X`, `### Description`, `### Technologies Used`, etc.) for each project to provide comprehensive information.

This format allows readers to quickly scan through your projects, understand their purpose, and find relevant links for further exploration. Adjust the content and sections based on the specifics of your projects and their requirements.
